# Weather Guardian 

## A Fun and Knowledgeable Challenge 

This task was not only **interesting** but also one of my **favorites**! The goal was to build a **Weather Guardian Chrome Extension** üåê, which allows users to enter the name of a place and get the **complete temperature and weather report** of that location.

## Task Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è

### Key Files for the Extension 
To create the extension, I worked with **four essential files**:
1. **`popup.html`** : For structuring the extension interface.
2. **`popup.css`** : For styling the design.
3. **`popup.js`** : The brain of the extension, handling the logic and functionality.
4. **`manifest.json`** : The configuration file for defining the extension's properties.

## The Process üìà

### Designing the Interface 
I started by designing a simple yet elegant interface in **`popup.html`** and styled it with **`popup.css`**. This step helped me visualize the user experience and make the extension visually appealing.

### Learning About `manifest.json` 
This was my first time working with JSON, and it was super exciting!   
The `manifest.json` file is like the heart of the extension, defining key details like:
- The **extension name**.
- **Permissions** needed (e.g., access to weather data).
- Linking the **popup** interface.

### Tackling the Hard Part: `popup.js` 
The **JavaScript file** was the most challenging yet rewarding part of this task!  
- I learned how to **fetch weather data** from an API .
- Displaying the fetched data dynamically on the extension interface was tricky, but I enjoyed every step! 
- Writing functions to handle errors and edge cases improved my problem-solving skills. 

### Overcoming Challenges 
- I watched **multiple tutorials** and referred to **official documentation** to understand JSON and JavaScript functionality better.
- Breaking down the task into smaller sections helped me stay organized and focused.
