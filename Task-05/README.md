# Pokémon Rescue 🌟

## One of My Favorite Tasks ❤️

This task was truly amazing and gave me an incredible learning experience in Python! The challenge was to **update a missing code** in the `search_window.py` file because Professor Oak had accidentally deleted some crucial parts of it. Here's how I tackled this exciting task step by step:

## Task Description 🔍

- **Objective:**  
  To create a fully functional application where:
  1. You can **search for Pokémon** by entering its name.
  2. The Pokémon's **abilities, stats**, and other details are displayed.
  3. You can **capture the Pokémon**, and the list of all captured Pokémon is shown in a separate window.

- **Challenge:**  
  Although the task sounded interesting at first, I soon realized it wasn’t as simple as I thought. The code was complex, with many unfamiliar modules, APIs, and functions, but I was ready to face the challenge! 🚀

## Approach 🛠️

### Exploring and Importing Essential Modules 📚
I started by importing and learning about several key modules that were crucial for the task:

- **PySide6.QtWidgets** 🖥️:  
  For creating the GUI elements like windows, labels, input fields, buttons, and message boxes.

- **PySide6.QtGui** 🎨:  
  Specifically, `QPixmap` was used to display the Pokémon images in the application.

- **requests** 🌐:  
  Used to interact with the Pokémon API and fetch real-time Pokémon data.

- **os & sys** 🗂️:  
  To handle file paths and system-related operations seamlessly.

- **glob** 🔍:  
  For managing file searches, which helped in organizing and accessing captured Pokémon.

### Understanding the Provided Code 📖
- The **main window code** was already provided. I carefully reviewed it to understand its functionality and how different components interacted with each other.
- I identified where the missing pieces of code were and mapped out a plan to fill in the gaps.

### Overcoming the Challenges 💪
- The task was **complex** due to the lengthy code and the new, advanced functions it used.
- I broke down the code into smaller sections to understand it better and became familiar with the **APIs** and **modules** involved.
- Gradually, I worked through the missing parts, tested the changes, and refined the code until it worked perfectly.

## Final Submission 🏆
- The application now works as expected:
  1. **Search Pokémon:** Enter a Pokémon name to fetch its details.
  2. **Display Details:** View abilities, stats, and more in the main window.
  3. **Capture Pokémon:** Save Pokémon to a collection and view all captured Pokémon in a separate window.

- For the full implementation, refer to the following files:
  - **`main.py`**
  - **`search_window.py`**

## Learning Outcome 🌟
This task taught me:
1. How to use **PySide6** to build user interfaces.
2. The power of **APIs** for fetching real-time data.
3. How to work with advanced Python modules and manage complex codebases.

Completing this task boosted my confidence, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve learned and achieved! 🎉🔥
