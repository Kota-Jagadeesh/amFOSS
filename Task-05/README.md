# Pokémon Rescue

## One of My Favorite Tasks

This task was truly amazing and gave me an incredible learning experience in Python! The challenge was to update a missing code in the `search_window.py` file because Professor Oak had accidentally deleted some crucial parts of it. Here's how I tackled this exciting task step by step:

## Task Description

- **Objective:**  
  To create a fully functional application where:
  1. You can search for Pokémon by entering its name.
  2. The Pokémon's abilities, stats, and other details are displayed.
  3. You can capture the Pokémon, and the list of all captured Pokémon is shown in a separate window.

- **Challenge:**  
  Although the task sounded interesting at first, I soon realized it wasn’t as simple as I thought. The code was complex, with many unfamiliar modules, APIs, and functions, but I was ready to face the challenge!

## Approach

### Exploring and Importing Essential Modules
I started by importing and learning about several key modules that were crucial for the task:

- **PySide6.QtWidgets**:  
  For creating the GUI elements like windows, labels, input fields, buttons, and message boxes.

- **PySide6.QtGui**:  
  Specifically, `QPixmap` was used to display the Pokémon images in the application.

- **requests**:  
  Used to interact with the Pokémon API and fetch real-time Pokémon data.

- **os & sys**:  
  To handle file paths and system-related operations seamlessly.

- **glob**:  
  For managing file searches, which helped in organizing and accessing captured Pokémon.

### Understanding the Provided Code
- The main window code was already provided. I carefully reviewed it to understand its functionality and how different components interacted with each other.
- I identified where the missing pieces of code were and mapped out a plan to fill in the gaps.

### Overcoming the Challenges
- The task was complex due to the lengthy code and the new, advanced functions it used.
- I broke down the code into smaller sections to understand it better and became familiar with the APIs and modules involved.
- Gradually, I worked through the missing parts, tested the changes, and refined the code until it worked perfectly.

## Final Submission
- The application now works as expected:
  1. **Search Pokémon:** Enter a Pokémon name to fetch its details.
  2. **Display Details:** View abilities, stats, and more in the main window.
  3. **Capture Pokémon:** Save Pokémon to a collection and view all captured Pokémon in a separate window.

- For the full implementation, refer to the following files:
  - **`main.py`**
  - **`search_window.py`**

## Learning Outcome
This task taught me:
1. How to use **PySide6** to build user interfaces.
2. The power of **APIs** for fetching real-time data.
3. How to work with advanced Python modules and manage complex codebases.

Completing this task boosted my confidence, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve learned and achieved!
