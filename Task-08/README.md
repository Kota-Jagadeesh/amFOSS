# Compute Shader 🖥️✨

I tried my best to work on this task and understand it, but I couldn’t complete it. However, I’ve learned a lot along the way and won’t stop here.

## What I Learned 📚

- I now have a better idea of what **compute shaders** are.  
- I learned that they are used for **parallel processing on the GPU**.  
- Even though I couldn’t implement it fully, I understood the basic concept and its importance.

## My Next Steps 🚀

I may not have finished this task, but I will keep learning and improving.  
- I plan to study more about compute shaders.  
- I will apply what I’ve learned so far and keep trying until I can complete it in the future.
