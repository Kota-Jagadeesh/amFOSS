# Flutter JumpStart

## Task Overview
This task was incredibly interesting but, unfortunately, I couldn’t complete it due to some prerequisites I needed to learn first. Here’s my experience:

## My Journey So Far
1. Dart Language:
   - I discovered that learning Dart is essential to work with Flutter.
   - Dart has similarities with C, C++, and Java, but since I’m new to coding, I needed to build my foundation first.

2. Python & C Language:
   - I started with Python and have gained a decent understanding of it.
   - I’ve also started learning C language, but I’ve only reached topics like conditional statements so far.

## Why I Couldn’t Complete the Task
Since I was focusing on learning C and Dart, I couldn’t allocate enough time for Flutter. By the time I decided to give it a try, the deadline was almost over.

## What’s Next?
I’m determined to:
- Learn Dart thoroughly.
- Move forward to explore Flutter and create amazing projects in the future!

Although I couldn’t complete this task now, I’m excited to work with Flutter soon and will definitely revisit this task once I’m ready. Stay tuned!
