# Flutter JumpStart 🚀📱  

## Task Overview  
This task was incredibly **interesting** but, unfortunately, I couldn’t complete it due to some prerequisites I needed to learn first. Here’s my experience:

## My Journey So Far 🌟  
1️⃣ **Dart Language:**  
   - I discovered that learning **Dart** is essential to work with Flutter.  
   - Dart has similarities with **C**, **C++**, and **Java**, but since I’m new to coding, I needed to build my foundation first.  

2️⃣ **Python & C Language:**  
   - I started with **Python** and have gained a decent understanding of it.  
   - I’ve also started learning **C language**, but I’ve only reached topics like conditional statements so far.

## Why I Couldn’t Complete the Task ❓  
Since I was focusing on learning **C** and **Dart**, I couldn’t allocate enough time for Flutter. By the time I decided to give it a try, the deadline was almost over.

## What’s Next? 🔮  
I’m determined to:  
- **Learn Dart** thoroughly.  
- Move forward to explore **Flutter** and create amazing projects in the future!  

Although I couldn’t complete this task now, I’m excited to work with Flutter soon and will definitely revisit this task once I’m ready. Stay tuned! 💪✨
