# Beat the Buttons

## Why I Loved This Task
This task was one of my absolute favorites because of my interest in web development! It was so satisfying to watch the webpage I created come to life. Here's how I tackled it step by step:

## Pre-task Preparation
Before starting the task, I already had a good understanding of HTML, but this task pushed me to learn and explore CSS and JavaScript, which are essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process and built my skills along the way.

## Task Description
The goal of the task was to design a webpage with seven buttons, where:
1. Each button, when clicked, would produce a unique sound.
2. The design and functionality should closely resemble the requirements outlined by the mentors in the provided README file.

## Implementation
- I started by designing the structure of the webpage using HTML.
- Next, I styled the buttons and the page using CSS, ensuring it looked appealing and met the task's requirements.
- Finally, I used JavaScript to add functionality. Specifically, I wrote code to ensure that:
  - Each button was associated with a unique sound.
  - Clicking the buttons triggered the appropriate audio playback.

## Completion
After carefully following the instructions, I successfully created a lookalike webpage as described in the task document. Seeing my code come to life with a functional and visually appealing webpage was incredibly rewarding.

## Files for Reference
- **index.html:** Contains the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css:** Manages the styling and layout.
- **index.js:** Adds interactivity and sound functionality.

## Learning Outcome
This task gave me:
1. A deeper understanding of CSS and JavaScript.
2. Hands-on experience in integrating design and functionality.
3. A huge boost of confidence seeing my webpage come to life!

I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this task, and it has further fueled my passion for web development.
