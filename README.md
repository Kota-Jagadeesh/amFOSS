GSoC is a prestigious program that allows students to work on open-source projects under the mentorship of experienced developers, contributing to real-world software while earning a stipend. Through active involvement in AMFOSS, I aim to:

- Strengthen my technical expertise.
- Gain valuable experience by contributing to open-source projects.
- Build a strong portfolio for GSoC.

By immersing myself in the collaborative and innovative environment of the club, I hope to make meaningful contributions while enhancing my skills and knowledge.
