## Goals in Joining the FOSS Club 🎯

My primary goal in joining the `AMFOSS Club` is to prepare for successful participation in the `Google Summer of Code (GSoC)` 🌐. GSoC is a prestigious program that allows students to work on **open-source projects** under the mentorship of experienced developers, contributing to real-world software while earning a stipend 💰. Through active involvement in `AMFOSS`, I aim to:

- Strengthen my technical expertise 🛠️.
- Gain valuable experience by contributing to open-source projects 🌍.
- Build a strong portfolio for GSoC 💼.

By immersing myself in the collaborative and innovative environment of the club, I hope to make meaningful contributions while enhancing my skills and knowledge.
