# Code the Puzzles

## Task Overview
This task involved solving five Python-based problems, each requiring logical thinking and programming skills. Here's how I approached it:

## My Progress
- I successfully solved three out of the five problems given in the task.
- As of my current knowledge, I managed to solve three problems, gaining valuable insights into approaching challenges logically and improving problem-solving skills.
- Despite multiple attempts, I couldn't crack the remaining two problems before the deadline. However, I am determined to keep working on them.

## Plan Moving Forward
- I will continue to practice and debug the unsolved problems to enhance my understanding and skills.
- Once I solve them, I will update the solutions in my README file as a record of completion.

## Learning Outcome
This task tested my Python proficiency and problem-solving skills. Even though I couldn't finish all the problems in time, the process was highly educational and motivating. The experience encouraged me to improve further and take on similar challenges in the future!
